# CustomTube

**Note that CustomTube has been discontinued. My current project, StarTube, is the successor, and it requires Vorapis 2013 (V3) to function.**

What if you could just CHOOSE your YouTube layout? Well, now you can! CustomTube lets you use almost any YouTube layout from 2008-2021!

CustomTube does not collect user data. I don't even know how to program that and I wouldn't want to anyway.

Compatible Extensions:
-
CustomTube is currently only tested with these extensions/scripts:

[Return YouTube Dislike](https://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike)

[Annotations Restored for YouTube](https://github.com/isaackd/AnnotationsRestored)

[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)

[Restore YouTube Username from Handle to Custom](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/468740-restore-youtube-username-from-handle-to-custom)

Using it with other extensions or scripts often causes issues and is therefore not recommended. 

If you have a user agent switcher installed, make sure it is disabled on youtube.com, as you may not be able to use anything other than the default 2017 layout otherwise.

CustomTube shares a small amount of code with YouTube Redux, namely the code for managing user settings.

The beta version makes use of the Return YouTube Dislike API - https://returnyoutubedislike.com
